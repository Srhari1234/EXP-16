## EXPERIMENT 16

## AIM:
To study and implement Exception Handling.

## THEORY:
An exception is an unexpected problem that arises during the execution of a program our program terminates suddenly with some errors/issues. Exception occurs during the running of the program (runtime).

## 1. TRY IN C++: 

The try keyword represents a block of code that may throw an exception placed inside the try block.
Itâ€™s followed by one or more catch blocks. If an exception occurs, try block throws that exception.

## 2. CATCH IN C++: 

The catch statement represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown from the try block.
The code to handle the exception is written inside the catch block.

## 3. THROW IN C++:

An exception in C++ can be thrown using the throw keyword.
When a program encounters a throw statement, then it immediately terminates the current function and starts finding a matching catch block to handle the thrown exception.
  
## 1. DIVISION WITH EXCEPTION HANDLING: 

```
//Name: Srihari Nair
//Prn: 23070123131
//Class: EnTC B-2
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    float n1,n2, ans;
    cout<<"enter the numbers 1 and 2: ";
    cin>>n1>>n2;
    try
    {
        if(n2==0)
        {
            throw n2;
        }
        else
        {
            ans = n1/n2;
            cout<<"answer = "<<ans<<endl;
        }
    }
    catch( float num)
    {
        cout<<"ERROR: division by "<<num<<endl;
    }
}
```

## 2. EXCEPTION HANDLING FOR AGE VALIDATION:

```
//Name: Srihari Nair
//Prn: 23070123131
//Class: EnTC B-2
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int age;
    cout<<"enter age: ";
    cin>>age;
    try
    {
        if (age<18)
        {
            throw age;
        }
        else
        {
            cout<<"age: "<<age<<"\nAPPROVED"<<endl;
        }
    }
    catch(int a)
    {
        cout<<"\nERROR: Underage ("<<age<<")"<<endl;
    }
}
```

## CONCLUSION:
In both programs, exception handling is used to ensure safe execution when certain invalid conditions arise.
* Division by Zero: The first code ensures that dividing by zero is avoided by throwing an exception when the denominator is zero. This prevents a runtime error and instead provides a clear 
  error message to the user.
* Age Validation: The second code uses exception handling to manage age validation, throwing an exception if the user inputs an age under 18. This enforces a rule and provides feedback without 
  crashing the program.
* Error Management: Exception handling allows a program to deal with unexpected events (such as dividing by zero or invalid input) without crashing, improving program stability.
* Separation of Concerns: The try block contains code that may throw an error, while the catch block handles the error. This separation keeps error-handling logic distinct from normal code execution.
* Throwing Exceptions: The throw keyword is used to raise an exception when an error condition is detected. It can be used with different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
